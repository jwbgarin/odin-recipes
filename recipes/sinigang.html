          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>Sinigang is a traditional Filipino soup known for its distinctive sour flavor, usually achieved by using tamarind as the primary souring agent. This dish is beloved for its refreshing and tangy taste, which makes it a perfect comfort food, especially during colder weather or rainy days.</p>
          <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Radish</li>
            <li>Water spinach</li>
            <li>Eggplant</li>
            <li>Long beans</li>

            <li>Green chili peppers</li>

          <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Sautéing: The garlic and onions are sautéed until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Simmering the Meat: The meat is added and browned, then simmered in water or broth until tender. If using tougher cuts of meat, this step might take longer.</li>
            <li>Adding Vegetables and Tamarind: Tomatoes and other vegetables are added in stages, depending on their cooking times. The tamarind pulp is often boiled separately to extract the juice, which is then added to the soup. Alternatively, a sinigang mix can be used for convenience.</li>
            <li>djusting Flavor: The soup is seasoned with fish sauce or salt, and sometimes a bit of sugar is added to balance the sourness.</li>
            <li>Final Touches: Towards the end of cooking, leafy greens and green chili peppers are added for flavor and a bit of heat.</li>
