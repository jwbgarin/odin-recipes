<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Adobo is often considered the unofficial national dish of the Philippines. Its name is derived from the Spanish word "adobar," meaning "to marinate," though the dish itself is indigenous to the Philippines and pre-dates Spanish colonization. The Spanish later gave the dish its name when they encountered the cooking method, but the practice of stewing meat in vinegar and spices was already a well-established part of Filipino culinary traditions.</p>
